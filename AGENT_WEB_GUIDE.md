## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **If the interface doesn't load:**
1. Check if all services are running:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags  # Ollama
   curl http://localhost:5001/api/status  # API
   curl http://localhost:5173  # Web interface
   ```

2. Restart the system:
   ```bash
   ./start_agent.sh
   ```

### **If responses are slow:**
- The local LLM takes time to process
- First response might be slower (model loading)
- Subsequent responses will be faster

### **If you get connection errors:**
- Make sure Ollama is running: `brew services start ollama`
- Check if the API server is running on port 5001
- Verify the web interface is accessible on port 5173
